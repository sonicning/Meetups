### 3. Code Review

   3.1 What/Why/How
   
   3.1.1 [What](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)
   
   Code review is systematic examination (sometimes referred to as peer review) of computer source code. It is intended to find mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving the overall quality of software. Reviews are done in various forms such as pair programming, informal walkthroughs, and formal inspections.
   
   代码的系统检查
   
   开发阶段，减少bug，提高代码质量，提高开发者编码能力
   
   形式多样：结对编程，非正式浏览（Over-the-shoulder），原始的email pass-around，**Tool-assisted code review**
   
   3.1.2 Why
   
   The purpose of a code review is for someone other than the programmer to critically go through the code of a module to ensure that it meets the functional and design specifications, is wellwritten and robust. An incidental benefit is that the reviewer may learn some new programming techniques, and more people in the team become familiar with the module. The reviewer should not try to fix any bugs or improve the code. S/he should merely inform the programmer about potential bugs and possible improvements. The responsibility for actually making the changes and testing them lies with the programmer.
   
   Reviewer批判性浏览代码，提供检视意见，而不是直接修改代码；Developer按照意见和建议，修改并测试代码。
   
   3.1.3 How
   
   Lightweight reviews are often conducted as part of the normal development process:
   
   Over-the-shoulder – one developer looks over the author's shoulder as the latter walks through the code.
   
   Email pass-around – source code management system emails code to reviewers automatically after checkin is made.
   
   Pair programming – two authors develop code together at the same workstation, as it is common in Extreme Programming.
   
   **Tool-assisted code review** – authors and reviewers use software tools, informal ones such as pastebins and IRC, or specialized tools designed for peer code review.
